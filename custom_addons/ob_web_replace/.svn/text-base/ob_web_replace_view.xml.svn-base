When opening that report, OfficeBrainBMA asks for the name of the company, the fiscal period and the size of the interval to be analyzed (in days). OfficeBrainBMA then calculates a table of credit balance by period. So if you request an interval of 30 days OfficeBrainBMA generates an analysis of creditors for the past month, past two months, and so on. "/>
